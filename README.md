# ESP8266-01  SoftAP y UDP Server

Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica  
Computer Engineering  
Introduction to programming and Programming Workshop  
2018

### Prerequisites
To run this project you will need:
1. ESP8266-01 WiFi module
2. Python 3.6.4 
3. Arduino IDE
4. USB Interfase between ESP8266 and PC

The libraries used are:
* Arduino
1. ESP8266WiFi.h
2. WiFiUdp.h
* Python
3. socket
4. sys
5. Time

## Getting Started
This is an example of how to create an access point with ESP8266 module working with UDP Server.
Also, an UDP Python Client is included, in order to demostrate a simple connection. 
This is an academic project, for that reason the internal documentation is in Spanish.


### Known problems
In my computer (toshiba ultrabook satellite u940) the controller resets when is trying to connecto to the AP.
The AP resets, this can be cause by an exception in the software or lack of power supply.
